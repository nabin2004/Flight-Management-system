/**
 * The ShowFlight class represents a command to display detailed information about a specific flight.
 * It implements the Command interface, allowing it to be executed within the context of a FlightBookingSystem instance.
 * 
 * <p>Upon execution, the command retrieves the flight information by its ID from the provided FlightBookingSystem instance.
 * It then prints the long details of the flight using the getDetailsLong() method of the Flight class.
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Create a new ShowFlight command instance for flight with ID 1001
 * Command showFlightCommand = new ShowFlight(1001);
 * 
 * // Execute the command within a FlightBookingSystem instance
 * showFlightCommand.execute(flightBookingSystem);
 * }</pre>
